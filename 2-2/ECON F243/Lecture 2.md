#### Tools of Macroeconomics
- Connections to Microeconomics
	- Sum of all microeconomic decisions made by individuals
	- Need to have knowledge of factors that influence these decisions
	- Aggregate demand is total demand for Goods and Services in the economy
	- Aggregate supply is total supply for Goods and Services in the economy
```
AD = C + I + G + X - M
```
Consumption, Investment, Government, Outsiders, Agrregate demand
```
AS = f(L,K,Tech)
```
- More complex than microeconomic counterparts
- Government plays a role in stimulating demand using Monetary and Fiscal Policy
- AD depends on total spending on Goods and Services 
- AS depends on level of prices, productive capacity (which further depends on availability of capital, labour and technology)
- AS = AD, ideal economic condition
- Till a certain point, the firm can produce more units without increasing price, because they have excess capacity (say you have a talented sandwich maker who can make 15 sandwiches an hour, but you only get an order for 5 per hour)
- Over here, their capacity is under-utilized, this is a recession kinda
- After that point, to produce more, you have to hire more workers, their wages add to the cost of the sandwiches, increase wage rate, factor price, this is the medium run
- To increase supply
- After even that point, you can invest in capital (sandwich makers, kiosks, etc), steeper price jump
- After that, we have reached **productive capacity**, any excess demand will only increase price, not production, we have utilized all possible resources, no unemployment, nothing idle, everything is put to work(This is theoretical of course)
- No additional labour/Capital, cant do anything
- These phases are called Short run, Medium Run and Long 

### Issues of Macroeconomics
- 3 areas of research typical
	- Attempt to understand the determinants of very long run economic growth (increases in national income)
	- These fluctuations are called business cycles
		- GDP Growth curve has 4 parts
			- Trend part: smoothed out, average, aka long term growth, ignore fluctuations, potential GDP even
			- Seasonal Fluctuations: Patterns based on particular months (Like how people spend more around Christmas and Diwali), fixed across the years
			- Cyclical Fluctuations: Recessions and Booms, not fixed
			- Residual
