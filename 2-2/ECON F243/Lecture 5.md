## Classical Macroeconomics

- Macroeconomics is one of the newer branches of Economics
- Started after the great depression(1930s)
	- After the 'Roaring 20s'
	- Rampant Unemployment
	- A Depression is a severe recession [[koirl/2-2/ECON F243/Lecture 3|Lecture 3]]
	- Unemployment increased by 25% in the UK
	- GDP decline, deflation
	- Economy in disequilibrium
- Determine output, employment, income, price level, etc
- John Keynes: Book General Theory of Employment, interest and money
- Solution on how to stabilise a depression
	- Government intervention via Fiscal and Monetary Policy
	- Short term Macroeconomics 
	- Keynesian Macroeconomics
- Macroeconomics before Keynes (Proto-Macroeconomics,if you will)
	- Classical
	- Neoclassical
- After Keynes
	- Monetarism
	- New Classical(not to be confused with Neoclassical)
	- Real Business Cycle
	- New Keynesian
- Ultimate objective is to determine output, employment and price level
- Classical 
	- Supply side
	- Long run
	- Adam smith (Wealth of Nations fame)
- Keynesian
	- Demand side
	- Short Run
	- John Keynes 


#### The Classical School

- The economy works well on its own
- Invisible hand
	- If there are free markets, and individuals conduct affairs in their own best interests, the economy will work well
- Wages and prices adjust to get to equilibrium
- Conclusion: Government should have a limited role in the economy

#### The Keynesian School
- The great depression exposed the failures of classical economics, as high unemployment persisted, it didnt self adjust
- Keynes: The reason for this is because wages and prices adjust slowly, so there are long periods of no equilibrium
- Conclusion: The government should intervene to restore full employment

### The Classical Revolution
- #### Revolution against mercantilism
	- Bullionism: wealth and power of a nation is determined by how much shiny metal you have (Bullion)
	- Active Government Policy: government coordination needed to direct the development of the capitalist system
		- Reduce imports, develop industry, etc
- #### Classical Theory
	- Real factors and productive capacity determine the 'wealth of a nation' ()
		- Increase in money supply doesnt matter all that much in comparison
	- Real factors
		- Labour
		- Natural Resources
		- etc
	- Increase production
	- Role of money
		- Simply a medium of exchange
		- A higher supply doesnt mean you have a better economy, its not going to increase production
		- It only increases the price level
	- Government Role
		- Practically non-existent
		- Only on very rare occasions, minimal is preferred
	- Production
		- All of it will be consumed 
		- "Supply creates its own demand"
		- Aggregate Production Function
		- Based on technology of individual firms, relationship between the level of output and the level of factor inputs
		- $$Y = F(\bar K  N)$$
		- With K being Capital(fixed) , N being Labour, Y = Output
		- Marginal Product of Labour
			- if you increase 1 unit of labour, how much output is increased
			- diminishing returns 
	- Labour Demand
		- Firms are perfect competitors, choose output to max profits
		- Increase output till Marginal Cost of Producing 1 unit if output = Marginal revenue received for its sale
		- $$MPN_i = \frac{W}{P}$$
		- $$\pi = TR - TC$$
		- $$\pi = P^*Y - (w^*L + r^*K*)$$
		- $$P^*Y = w^*L + r^*K*$$
		- $$P^* \triangle Y = w^*\triangle L + 0$$
		- $$\frac{\triangle Y}{\triangle L} = \frac{w}{P}$$
		- $$\therefore MP_L = \frac{W}{P}$$
		- Increase in wage rate proportional to Employment
	- Labour Supply
		- The individual attempts to maximise utility(or satisfaction)
		- Depends on real income and leisure
		- Trade off between both goals, as income is increased by work ,which reduces time for leisure
