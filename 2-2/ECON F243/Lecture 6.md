## A Recap on Classical Macroeconomics
- To grow a country's GDP, we have to invest in a country's real factor
	- Labour
	- Capital
	- Infrastructure
	- etc
- Money -> only a medium of exchange
	- An increase in supply will only affect the price level, not the GDP
- Market Economy
	- Free market, minimal government intervention
	- Laissez-Fairez Economy

- $$Y = f(\bar{K},N)$$
- 
- $$\triangle Y= \triangle N$$
- for $\triangle N$ you need to consider demand and supply of labour
- $$D_L \propto \frac{1}{W/P}$$
- $$SS_L \propto \frac{W}{P}$$
- At a certain level of compensation, the level of work is the highest, after which, the effects of leisure starts to outweigh the need to work. 
- Basically, if you're getting paid a certain amount, you'll have enough to live comfortably, and you'll spend less time working, and more time in leisure (and we cant have that now, the capitalism machine needs you to work at your full potential)
- This is also known as the substitution/income effect
- Income effect: You use your income to 'purchase' leisure (it helps to think of leisure as a good)
- Substitution effect:

- $$N^d = f(\frac{W}{P})$$
- $$N^s = g(\frac{W}{P})$$
- for equilibrium $N^s = N^d$
- get output, employment and real wage
- Designated as endogenous variables in the model to this point
- exogenous would be variables that can affect this, but are not in the equation
- Equilibrium in labour market yields the market real wage $(W/P)_O$
- In the classical model, these variables are the ones that shift the labour supply and demand curves and the position of the aggregate production function
	- Production Function shift: Tech change, capital stock(Say the company's bought some new machines.)
	- Labour Demand: Labour Productivity, Capital Stock
	- Labour Supply Shift: Population growth, size of force, wealth, wage rate
- In the classical model, the levels of output and employment are determined solely by supply factors

((Insert graphs here))

- Real wage is $W/P$
- Money Wage is $W$
- If the price increases, the employment isnt affected, only affected if the nominal wage rate exceeds the rise in price level


#### The Aggregate Supply Curve
- plot various levels of prices, and their Y level, we get a vertical aggregate supply curve
- Level of real output unaffected by nominal variables
- Real output only affected by real variables

- Shifts
	- Change in capital stock
	-
