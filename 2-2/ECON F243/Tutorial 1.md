### First step in measuring National Income: Gross Domestic Product

- Market value(final cost, includes intermediate costs, net indirect taxes ) of all final goods and services (If you count the bread, you wont count the wheat used to bake it)produced within a country in a given period of time
- Doesnt count second hands or exchanges of previous goods and services
- Flow concept

#### Different Approaches to calculating GDP

- Expenditure Approach
	- Total expenditure, which is related to total demand
	- also called demand method
- Production/Value Added Approach
- Income approach
	- Add income of all people in India
- All 3 yield the same results, total expenditure = value of goods and services produced = total income paid to factors that produced the goods and services

#### Rules
- use market prices for total value of goods and services
- Used goods are not counted
- Inventory changes are added to GDP, their value is added. Their spoilage does not change this, when sold, they become used goods, and a negative change is added to GDP
- Intermediate goods are not counted, as their value is accounted for by the market price
- Some goods not sold in the market are not counted, as they do not have a market price
	- eg. A housewife doing chores


#### Expenditure Approach

GDP @ Market price = $C + I + G + X - M$



- ##### Consumption($C$)
	- Purchases made by households
	- Durable, non durable and services
	- Primary component of demand
	- eg. BITS fees is consumption, according to the GDP, even though you may consider it an investment
- ##### Government Expenditure($G$)
	- Compensation of employees, purchase of goods and services(army, roads), consumption of fixed capital
	- Transfer payments like social seCurity, unemployment, are not included as they are not a part of current production
	- $G$ = transfers + purchases
- ##### Investment($I$)
	- Additions to physical stock of capital(Machinery, factories, addition to inventory)
	- Households constructing a new house will be Investment, rent will be consumption
	- Human capital investment is a part of $G$, if Goverment funded, $C$ if personally funded
	- Purchase of stocks, rare coins or deposits in savings are not I because these do not produce new goods (Purchase of stocks in the Primary market are a part of $I$ though)
	- Business expenditure on consumption goods is a part of  intermediate consumption, not GDP
	- Investment has been on a decline since 2011 because of declining savings in the household sector
 - ##### Net Exports
	 - Exports - Imports
	 - Purchases of foreign goods

#### GDP: Value added Approach(Production Approach)
- GDP is the sum of value added in the economy during a period
- Value added = Valued of output - Value of Intermediates
- Three sectors for easier calculation
	- Agriculture, Industry, Service
- Calculate for all 3, you can subdivide if necessary
- VA is the extra value created, sum of value-added is known as GPD at factor cost
- GDP at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subidies is GDP at market price
- $GDP_{MP} = GDP_{FC}$ + (indirect taxes - subsidies)
- Final selling price is the sum of all values added to the product at each stage of production
- GST collected goes to the government, nobody's income

#### GDP: Income Approach
- Sum of Incomes in economy
- INcomes that firms pay households for factors of profuction they hire are added
	- Labour Income + Rental Income + Interest Income + Profits
	- (WRITE ALL LATER)
- These 4 are all part of Net Domestic Income at factor cost
- 2 adjustments to get GDP(market price
	- Indirect taxes - Subsidies added to get from factor cost to market prices
	- Depreciation to get it from NDP to GDP


### GNP vs GDP
 - $GNP = GDP$ + Net factor income from abroad (NFI)
 - NFI = Factor income received - payments made to foreign factors
- Indian working in Korea for Aditya Birla contributes to our GNP, but Korean GDP
- Geography vs nationality


##### Nominal vs Real

### The new GDP series
- not part of the exam, for your knowledge
- 3 components of this revision
	- Change of base year
	- Review methodology(read it on your own at this point I think)
