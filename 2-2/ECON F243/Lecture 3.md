### The very long run model
- Ignore booms, recessions, fluctuations
- how much it grows on average
- Growth theory examines how accumulation of inputs and improvements in tech impact standards of living
- Long run, Trend GDP, Potential GDP growth
- Long run is usually 10 years ,VLR 50
- Why do countries exhibit differential long run growth trajectory?
	- Japan's miraculous 8% growth rate?
	- Hindu growth rate of 3.5%
	- Zimbabwe's 0 or even negative rate?
- Why is it harder for countries to sustain high growth rates?

	#### Long Run model
- Fixed capacity
- Output is determined by supply side, price level by demand
- decrease in prices is worse than increases in price, a healthy level of inflation is ideal
- Why? Find out after these commercials!

- Larger rates of inflation are always due to changes in the AD curve

#### Short Run Model
- AS curve is flat due to fixed prices
- fluctuations due to changes in AD
- Changes in AD constitute phases of the business cycle
	- AD determines output and unemployment
	- Prices not affected

#### Business cycles
- Why does an economy exhibit cyclical peaks and troughs?
- what effects do these have on output and unemployment and inflation
- Do we need govt intervention
- Say demand is lower, changes in monetary policy?
	- Increase cash flow (reduce Interest rate, bond buybacks)
- Minimize deviation
- Say demand > Supply, RBI can increase IR

### Medium Run
- Pretty much the same

#### Main Issues in Macroeconomics
- Economic growth and Fluctuations
- Jobs and unemployment
- Inflation
- Surpluses and Deficit
- International trade linkages
- Macro Policy

- How to achieve higher economic growth with stability

- Economic growth is the expansions of production possibilities
- Growth is the increase in aggregate outputs
- Real GDP is the value of total production of all of a nation's businesses


#### Fluctuations
- A business cycle is the short term tendency for output and employment to fluctuate along trend path
- Output Gap: difference in actual output and potential output, can be negative or positive depending on peak or trough
- Short turn alteration  between downturns and upturns
- Recessions are periods where aggregate output and employment decline, two consecutive quarters of decrease in output signal a recession
- This, if prolonged becomes a depression
- Expansion is a period where the real GDP increases
	- Business Cycle peak: Expansion to recession
	- Business Cycle trough: Recession to expansion
- National Bureau of Economic research, USA



### Challenges
- Boost growth
- Low Inflation
- Stabilize Business cycle
- Reduce unemployment
- Reduce government deficits

### Policy Tools
- Fiscal Policy
	- Taxes and spending, govt policy
- Monetary Policy
	- Tools used by Central Bank to control quantity of money in economy
- both affect the AD curve of the economy
- Only effective in short term, minimize Output gap, cant increase potential production
- Growth policies focus of stimulating AS instead of AD
	- SEZs, Education Spending, Reducing taxes

TUT TOMORROW! DONT FORGET!

- **Stock and Flow Variable** (Could come in quiz, pay attention to this)
	- Stock: Particular point of time, accumulative stuff (debt, money supply, etc)
	- Flow: 2 time periods
	- Think Balance Sheet and P/L Account
