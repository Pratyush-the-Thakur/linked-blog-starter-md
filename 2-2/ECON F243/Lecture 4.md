### Issues in National Income Accounting
- Household clothing and laundry services were worth more than $100B in 2012
- this was called unpaid GDP
- household work in India to be measured soon
- Data can help address issues like gender equality, women empowerment, and unemployment
- Treatment of non-marketed outputs
- Illegal transactions and the black economy
	- Can be almost 40% of out GDP, and its just... not accounted for?
	- If a business deals mostly in cash, high likelihood that they are dealing in black money (Easier to hide)
	- A large Informal sector reflects poor government policies like high taxes, low confidence in private property security from government seizures, etc
- Environmental damage
	- can be accounted for with green GDP
	- Higher risk rates for industries notorious for high pollution
- Improvement in goods quality without any changes in price

### Inflation, Deflation, and Disinflation
- Inflation: Increase in price level
	- 2 - 6% is considered healthy for us
- Deflation: Take a guess mate
	- extended periods of this can be as bad as continued high inflation!
	- this is actually whats happening in China right now, and its not good
- Disinflation:
	- Inflation rates falling, although still positive

#### GDP Deflator
- ratio of nominal to real GDP
- GDP deflator of year 1 to 0 is$$\frac{\sum P^1_iq^1_i}{\sum P^0_iq^1_i}$$
#### Wholesale Price Index
- aka Producer's price index
- Weighted avg of prices of wholesale market goods
- Not an index of all transactions as services are excluded
- Represents prices at intermediate demand, not the final demand
#### Consumer Price Index
- Price of buying a standard basket of goods 
- From the POV of the final consumer
- Laspeyre's index = $$\frac{\sum P^1_iq^0_i}{\sum P^0_iq^0_i} * 100$$
- Paaschey's Index (GDP Deflator) = $$\frac{\sum P^1_iq^1_i}{\sum P^0_iq^1_i} * 100$$
- includes imports, as does WPI
- Used to have CPI for 
	- Industrial
	- Urban
	- Agricultural labourers
	- Rural 
#### Limitations of GDP Deflator
- Does not take service into account
- Does not consider imported products or technology used in production of Goods and services
- Quarterly frequency often not enough, compared to monthly for CPI

#### Problems in measuring cost of living
- CPI is an accurate measure of the goods in the bundle, not an accurate measure of Cost of living
- Often overestimates Inflation rate
- Substitution bias
	- Basket doesnt change to reflect consumer reaction to relative price changes
	- Say Apples double in price, you'll probably just switch to eating oranges or pears for your evening snack
	- Index does not consider this, thinks you'll just buy the inflated goods like some chump
- Introduction of New goods
	- New products offer greater variety, makes each dollar more valuable
	- This means we need less money to maintain our standard of living
- Unmeasured Quality changes
	- if the quality of goods rises, the value of the rupee rises, even though the price remains the same
	- Compare the average android phone to some similarly priced phone from 10 years ago, now we have double cameras, better processors, HD screens, etc. The good itself has risen supremely in quality, but it costs the same!
	- Vice versa if this falls
### Headline Inflation vs Core Inflation
- India's Headline inflation measure is the CPI-Combined
- Core inflation corresponds to the component of inflation that is likely to continue for a long time
	- captures Inflation trends
	- Exclude highly volatile components like food and fuel
	- Central banks tend to focus on Core inflation
	- if food becomes cheaper due to great harvests, the inflation will drop even if the prices across the floor are generally higher

### Identifying Unemployment
- How does the government measure the Unemployment rate?
- The problems with this
- How long are the unemployed usually without work?
- (Refer to slides for this, we didnt really discuss this in class)

#### Why are there always some people unemployed?
- in an ideal labor market, wages would self adjust to balance supply and demand, and everyone would have work
- Alas, we do not live in an ideal world
- Frictional Unemployment
	- time spent between jobs
	- if you quit a job and seek another job, you'll be unemployed
- Structural Unemployment
	- Structural changes might cost you your job
	- Say the minimum wage rises and you're a poor daily wage labourer
	- Your employer cant afford to hire as many people as he once did
		- (He'll probably just pay you less money and you wont report it because you need a job, but lets assume he's a good, law abiding citizen)
	- He fires you to protect his bottom line
	- Or.. if a factory switches from manual workers to automated workers, you're getting the axe, my friend.
	- Now you will have to find a job in another sector
- These two are kind of unavoidable, every country from Sweden to Somalia has these issues (Some moreso than others)
- When the potential GDP = Actual GPD, Unemployment will only be the previous two factors
- This is Full employment
	- NOT 100% employment, get that in your head
- Seasonal Unemployment
- Cyclical Unemployment
