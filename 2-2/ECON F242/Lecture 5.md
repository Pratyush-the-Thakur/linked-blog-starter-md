![[Pasted image 20240118170043.png]]
- Prices and income are exogenous
- Budget constraints
$$p_1q_1 + p_2q_2 + ....  p_i + q_i .... p_n + q_n = \sum^n_{i=1}p_iq_i  \le m$$
- Most preferred bundle is chosen subject to Budget constraint
$$q_i = D_i(p_i;)$$
- for all $i$ = 1,2,3.... n
- Model preference on individual


### Budget Set
- Say n = 2 for visualization purposes
- $$q_2 = \frac{m}{p_2} - \frac{p_1}{p_2}q_1$$
$$p_1q_1 + p_2q_2 = m$$
$$\frac{\triangle q_2}{\triangle q_1} = -\frac{p_1}{p_2}$$
- $\frac{\triangle q_2}{\triangle q_1}$ is the rate at which  a consumer with fixed income can exchange $q_1$ for $q_2$ at the market
- If you purchase 0 $q_2$, i.e. $q_2 = 0$
$$q_1 = \frac{mp_2}{p_1p_2} = \frac{m}{p_1}$$
- max amount of $q_1$ you can buy is $\frac{m}{p_1}$, which is also the x intercept of the graph
- similarly, $q_{2} = \frac{m}{p_2}$
- This assumes constant prices 

#### Observations of budget set F

- ##### Bounded
	- bounded by $q_i \ge 0$ for all i
	- from above by the constraint $\sum^n_{i=1}p_iq_i \le m$
	- if $p_1 = 0$, it becomes unbounded to the right ($q_{2_{max}} = \infty$)
- ##### Closed
	- any bundle on the budget line or q axes are available
	- Say $q_2 >x$, like if q2 is for food, or life saving medicine, the min axes shift upwards
- ##### Convex
	- Join any two points in this set with a line, every point on this line is a part of the set as well
	- Can become non convex with volume discounts(you get a discount if you buy more than x amount of a product). 
	- Say Product A has a volume discount
	- This implies that with the price you pay for y units of Product A ($y>x$), you would not get a proportional amount of Product B which does not offer a Volume discount. which means that bundle would lie outside your budget constraint
	- Volume Penalties are also a thing, more expensive if you buy more, this happens when goods are rationed.
- ##### Non-empty
	- provided $m>0$, at least one price is finite 
	- the consumer can buy a positive amount of atleast one good

#### Changes in Income and the budget line
- Inwards if income falls, Bundles become unaffordable as the budget set shrinks
- Outwards if income rises,  Budgets become affordable as the budget set expands
- However, the slope ($m$) remains unchanged
- m only changes with changes in the values of p and q
- if you change both $p_1$ and $p_2$ by the same factor $\lambda$
$$(\lambda) p_1q_1 + (\lambda)p_2q_2 = m$$
$$p_1q_1 + p_2q_2 = \frac{m}{\lambda}$$
- This is how VAT works, makes prices change at equal proportions, like Income tax, better?
- Taxation of all commodities at the same rate ($\lambda > 1$)
- Subsidies would be ($\lambda < 1$)

#### Simultaneous changes in income and prices
- Equiproportional change does not change the budget set
- Keeps the purchasing power the same
- Dearness Allowance given to government employees
- say $p_1$ and $p_2$ have gone up by $\lambda$, budget set contracts
- DA rate is chosen such that m increases exactly by a factor of $\lambda$ to counteract the effect of $m$ becoming $\frac{m}{\lambda}$
