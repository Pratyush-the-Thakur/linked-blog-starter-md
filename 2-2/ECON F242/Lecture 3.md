- max price someone is willing to pay is called their _reservation price_
- endogenous and exogenous variables


### Experiment
- Done by Vernon Smith of Purdue University
- Buyers receive a card listing a value for a unit of a product from 0.75 to 3.25, differing by 0.25
- Sane with sellers for cost of producing
- Say a buyer has a card of $1, he wont buy untill the price falls below $1, vice versa for sellers

- Elasticity (Percentage Change of demand due to Percentage cahnge of supply)of demand and supply
$$Q_{d} = a-bP$$
$$Q_s = c+dP$$

$$E = \frac{P}{Q} * \frac{\delta Q}{\delta P}$$

$$E_d = -b * \frac{P}{Q}$$
$$E_s = d * \frac{P}{Q}$$
