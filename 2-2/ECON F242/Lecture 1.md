#### What is Microeconomics
- Macro and Microeconomics differ in scale 
- Markets: Buyers buy and Sellers sell

### Scope
- Product Market
	- Individuals(Consumers) Buy from the Product Market
	- Individuals' Expenditure flows into the Product Market
	- Firms Sell in the Product Market
	- Firms sell goods, get Firms' Earning (Revenue)
- Factor Market
	- Individuals offer services in the Factor Market (Selling their Labour, Selling shares, etc)
	- Firms buy Individual Labour. Firm Expenditure flows into Factor Market, and is thereby used by Individuals to Purchase products in the Product market
- Both are interconnected
	- eg. Company suffers losses, your wages get cut, so you buy less products,

### Market
- Defined by specific Product being traded, location, and point in time
- Cant club all markets together for analysis because of how different they are
- Broadly defined in practice. Terms of product, factor (Skilled/Unskilled, etc), location, time period
- Broader markets are of more interest, give us more data, but definitions that are too broad can make models predictive and more complicated


### Classification of Markets
- Perfectly Competitive 
	- Homogenous Product, many sellers, buyers (both price takers)
	- Cant increase price or nobody will buy, cant decrease price or you suffer loses
	- Cannot affect the market price in any meaningful way
- Monopoly
	- One product, One Seller, many buyers
	- Control's price completely
- Monopolistic Competition
	- Many varieties, each seller selling a particular variety, many buyers(price takers)
	- Control price of a particular variety
- Oligopoly
	- Monopoly with a few sellers (1)controlling the market
	- Partial Control 
- Monopsony
	- 1 Product, many sellers(price takers) , one buyer
	- Like a Monopoly, but flipped
- Oligopsony
	- Monopsony with a few buyers
	- sellers are still price takers





#### Terms
- Price Taker
	- a company that must accept the prevailing prices in the market of its products, its own transactions being unable to affect the market price.
