- Price of product adjusts itself to match market demand with market supply
- Also determines the volume and value of transaction
- Turnover = $P_{eq}$ * $Q_{eq}$

- Linearity assumed for simplicity

#### Demand Curve
- Shows how much buyers are willing to purchase at a particular price
- Function of Price

$$D(p) = a - bp$$

$$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p} = -b$$

- Substitute products: If Product A rises in price, and the consumer purchases Product B, which is in a similar price range, to replace product A, Product B is a substitute for Product A.
	- eg: Rice and Wheat, Tea and Coffee

#### Supply Curve
- Shows how much sellers want to sell at each possible price
- Function of price
$$S(p) = -c + dp$$
$$\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p} = d$$
#### Market Equilibrium
- ++Demand, Price increases, $Q_s$ increases, $Q_d$ decreases
- lower excess demand until it disappears

- Perfectly competitive price mechanism
	- Excess demand, price adjusts upwards
	- Excess supply, price downwards
	- How? who knows
- This is called a t√¢tonnement process
- Think of a god of Finance who physically pushes the price up and down based on the demand and supply. They are the Walrasian Auctioneer (both buyers and sellers are price takers in this case)

- Non existence of an equilibrium price is also possible ($S_q \neq D_q$ , ever)

### Stable and Unstable Equilibrium
