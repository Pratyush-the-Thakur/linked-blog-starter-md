### P1
- $$Q_{DO} = 75 - 5P_O + P_c + 2I$$
- slope = $\frac{dP_o}{dQ_{DO}} = \frac{-1}{5}$
$$Q_{DO} = 75 - 5P_O + 5 + 20$$$$Q_{DO} = 100-5P_O$$
i) when $P_O$ = 5, $Q_{DO}$ = 75
which means, 75 organic carrots are demanded at that price point

- Carrots and organic carrots are substitutes
- endogenous change = move along curve
- exogenous change = curve shifts

### P2

Van gogh paintings
- Perfectly inelastic (Since Van gogh is dead, you cant get more, the price is dictated solely by the demand. The quantity supplied is not affected by the price at all, therefore it is inelastic)
- draw the supply curve

$$Q = 50-0.5P$$

### P3
	$Q_d = 430 - 10P_A + 10P_C - 10P_G$
	$P_G$ = 3, 
	$P_A, P_C = 20,000$
	$Q_D = 100,000$
Cross price elasticity (wrt to)

$$\frac{dQ_D}{dP_c} *\frac{P_C}{Q_D}$$
$10 * \frac{20,000}{100,000} = 2$
wrt gasoline = $-10 * \frac{3}{100} = -0.3$

Gasoline is a complement, so if the price increases, the demand for a car goes up

### P4

$$Q_D = A - BP$$
$$\frac{dQ_d}{dP} = -B$$
$$60 = A - B$$
$$E_D = -1 = \frac{dQ_D}{dP}\frac{1}{60}, B = 60$$
$$A = 120$$


### P5
$$\frac{dQ_d}{dA} \frac{A}{Q_D} = \frac{d (-Blog(P) + log(A))}{dlog(A)} = 1$$
