#### Types of Economic Data
- Experimental data (from controlled experiments)
- Nonexperimental data
	- Cross-sectional
	- Time-series
	- Pooled cross sectiond
	- Panel/Longitudinal data
- Methods/Model depend on the nature of the data used


### Cross Sectional Data
- Samples at a given point of time
- MOSPI, NSO, GOI
- Different Samples ach time

### Pooled Cross-sectional Data
- 2+ cross-sectional surveys combined
- Often used to evaluate policy changes
### Time Series Data
- Observing variable(s) over time
- trends and seasonality
### Panel Data
- Same cross sectional units followed over time
- Account for time-invariant unboservables
- Same variables every time
