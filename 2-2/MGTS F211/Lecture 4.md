### Goals of a Manager
- Make profit/Surplus
- Even non-profits need to make profit to self-sustain(They call it surplus)
- How? Be productive
- Productivity is an output/input ratio within a specified time period considering quality
- Productivity implies **effectiveness**(achieve goals we set)and **efficiency**(resource usage, low waste, optimisation) in individual and organizational performance
- S.p * q - (FC + VC)= profit/loss
- FC is stuff like rent, wages
- VC is raw materials, whatever (You've done this in POE [[8]] )
