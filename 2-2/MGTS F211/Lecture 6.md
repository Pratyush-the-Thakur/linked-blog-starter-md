### Introduction
- Is a manager directly responsible for an organisation's success and failure?
	- Yes: Omnipotent view
	- No: Symbolic view
		- Several factors he cannot control
		- He cant exactly force a customer at gunpoint to buy his product (Usually)
- Managerial decisions are constrained by the Internal and External environment he finds himself in


#### External Environment
- Factors outside the organisations's boundaries
- Potential to affect performance (Good or Bad)
- Need to monitor and respond to this
#### Internal Environment
- Factors within the organisation's boundary
- Managers can plan and control the environment
