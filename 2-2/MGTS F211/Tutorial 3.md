#### Levels of management
- Like a pyramid
- Top
	- Single position, CEO/Vice Chancellor
	- 'White Collar Job'
	- Functioning of the entire org
	- Set direction, long term objectives, vision, etc
	- Org-wide policy approval
	- They report to the Board of directors (they arent technically part of the company, they're representatives of the shareholders)
	- C-suits(CEO,CFO,CTO, etc)
- Middle
	- Responsible for specific function, departmental heads
	- Operations, marketing, HR, etc
	- Only responsible for their particular area (Marketing guy isnt gonna have much say in the finance department)
	- General managers, Division heads, etc
- Bottom
	- Blue collar
	- Not involved in much planning, carry out basic work
- Nomenclature is a bit misleading, importance could vary depending on the nature of the organisation
- But generally, the chain of command is the same everywhere 
	- Bottom -> Middle -> Top
- Maintain good relationships with superiors and subordinates (Vertical Relationships)
- Maintain good relationships with peers (Horizontal Relationships)
- PDC : Planning, Doing, Controlling
	- Level 1 is mostly planning, very little doing, and some control (Control is controlling what the level beneath you is doing)
	- Level 2 is mostly doing, less control, and a little more planning
	- Level 3 is almost completely doing, very little planning, and generally no control (Why? Because there is no level beneath them to control!)
