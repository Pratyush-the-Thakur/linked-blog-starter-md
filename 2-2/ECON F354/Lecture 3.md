### More on Forwards
- Say the spot price for 6 shares is now $3000. Person L will profit $2500, as instead of buying it in the open market for $3000, he buys it from S for $500. He can immediately then, sell it for $3000.
- Say the spot price for 6 shares is now $100, Person S has gained $400, as instead of selling it in the open market for $100, he has sold it to L for $500. 
- Bullish expectation: Long has Bullish expectation as he expects the spot price to increase in the near future, aka the Long position
- Bearish Expectation: Short expects the spot price to fall in the future, aka the short position
- Risk that counterparty will default
- Contract specifies:

 - Reliance example done in class
 - Bid price: price at which you can sell, usually lower
 - Ask price: Price at which you can buy, usually higher
 - REL future expiring Jan 25
	 - futures price (same as Strike Price)
	 - Person A takes Long at Jan 12th, 2700 for 1 share, (contract, you dont buy it), expires on Jan 25th
	 - At Jan 15th, price rises to 2790 at Jan 15th. Say you think its not gonna go higher, you can exit
	 - Dilemma! You do not have the asset yet, only the contract, what now?
	 - You decide to take the opposite position for 1 share. You can sell the contract at 2790 now
	 - Settlement is 2790 - 2700 = 90, at Jan 15th itself, nothing happens at Jan 25th
	 - This is also called 'squaring off'
