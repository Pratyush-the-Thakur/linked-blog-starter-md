- ### Markets
	- Buyers and sellers exchange financial assets
	- Real assets: Goods like Consumer goods, land, buildings, knowledge, etc
	- Financial Assets: 
		- Dont directly contribute to productivity
		- Paper assets
		- Claims on real assets: 
			- eg: Reliance has 1 piece of land, some machines. These are real, in Balance sheets, etc
			- Company wants to distribute financial assets (shares) amongst shareholders
			- X$ Share = X$ claim on their real assets
			- Does not count for revenue and stuff


	- Q: Why care about Share prices if not 'real'?
		- If higher share prices, signals that company is performing well
		- Can use to take out loans, lesser cost of capital (Interest rate)
		- Higher Dividends if you hold shares (If the share prices increase)

#### Real VS Financial Asset
- Real
	- Long Time horizon 
		- eg. If you buy Land, selling it takes time, so people typically hold it for long
	- Less liquid
		- eg. Land again. Finding a buyer, valuation of land, etc. Not very convenient
	- Not divisible
		- eg. Cant split an acre of land into 1000 equal pieces and sell it, nobody's gonna buy that
- Financial
	- Can be Short/Long
		- eg. You can buy it one day, sell it the other day, Or even hold it for a longer period if you want to
	- Liquid
		- Can Buy and Sell instantaneously
	- Divisible
		- eg. Self explanatory

### Types of Financial Markets

	- Primary:
		- Enter market for first time
		- Need huge amounts of money to continue next stage 
		- Get funds from Individuals

		- Validates the existence of Primary Market, because now people can buy shares for selling them later, instead of just for Dividends
