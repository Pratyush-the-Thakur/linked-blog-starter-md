- Exchange traded
	- Buyers and Sellers meet at a centralized place
		- Managed by exchanged (BSE, NSE)
		- Standardized products(Pre-defined Maturity dates, sizes, etc all are fixed)
		- High Liquidity, real time prices
		- Exit easily (Beware the transaction fee though)
		- Margin Requirement: the initial margin requirement is the amount of cash or collateral required to actually purchase securities, ensures a lower risk of trading
		- eg. Futures, Options
- Over the counter
	- Dealers market, no real time prices
	- Possible to negotiate prices
	- Customized products (maturity, shares, etc)
	- Low liquidity, you'll have to find another buyer if you want to exit
	- Higher credit risk due to no Margin requirements
	- eg. Forex, Forwards, Government Securities


### Basic types of Derivatives

- #### Forward
	- Pretty much the same as Futures(next class), definition-wise
	- Gives the owner the right and obligation to buy an asset on a specific date for a specific price
	- Vice Versa for the seller
	- On date of delivery, asset is transferred and payment is made
	- Long: Person who is buying
	- Short: Person who is selling
	- The price is known as the Strike Price, the date is called the maturity date
	- eg. 
		- Person L has agreed to  buy 6 shares of Reliance for $500 on the 14th of January,
		- Person S has agreed to sell it to them at this agreed price. 
		- No money is being transferred, only an agreement has been made
		- On the Maturity date, the spot price does not matter, the exchange will occur solely based on the terms of the contract
		
- 

- Forwards and Options are the two main types of Derivatives
