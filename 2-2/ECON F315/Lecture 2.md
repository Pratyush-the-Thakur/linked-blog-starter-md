### Increasing the value of the firm
- Any decision should lead to the increase of the value of the firm
- But what does this mean?
	- Increasing shareholder wealth
	- Asset: Generate revenue
		- Asset turnover ratio: Ability to generate revenue
		- Efficiency
	- Increase Sales revenue enough to increase firm value
	- Minimize cost
	- Debt, interest payments, Corporate tax
	- After all that, we get net income/profit
	- If positive, are we creating value? Not necessarily!
		- Could just be short term profits
		- Consider Cash Flow statement, recent regulations require this being published too
		- Possible to be profitable, but have a negative cash flow
			- High Accounts receivable (You've performed a service, your customer has not paid yet)
			- Untill you receive payment, you have not created value
			- Cash Flow
				- Operations
				- Investments
				- Loans
			- Earlier, people used to indirectly calculate it using P/L, Bal sheet
			- You are creating value if you are a cash generating firm
			- Difference between Profit and Cash Flow
	- Common equity holder
		- residual claimant
		- After everything is paid(Taxes, etc)
		- If their wealth in increasing, the firm's value is increasing
		- Only true for non financially distressed firms
			- If a firm is unable to pay off debt in a timely manner(if at all)
			- Nearing Bankruptcy
			- now, maximising shareholder wealth and firm value do not coincide
			- Agency Cost of Debt
				- There is a principal(owner), an agent(manager)
				- Conflict between them
				- the cost to alleviate this conflict is known as indirect Agency cost




- Owners are a set of shareholders
- Delegate day to day operations to managers
- Owners want their wealth to increase
- All decisions do not necessarily lead to this though
- Why? Agency cost/Relationship
	- Conflicts of interest. Everyone maximises their own self interest
	- How to align the two?
	- Give them ESOPs (Employee Stock Options)
	- Option to buy stock at a discounted rate, now you have an incentive for the company to do well, as your wealth is directly tied to the value of your ESOP! Genius, right?
	- Earlier, managers were paid based on their profit(Say if you generate $x of profit, you are paid 0.004x), led to more short-term focused decisions, not as great for the firm/shareholders
- Board of directors make sure the managerial decisions are optimal for the shareholders
- A lot of research done, composition, number of members, etc.
- More costs, sitting fees, etc, these all come under indirect agency costs
- Market discipline:
	- An effective market with a lot of top managers, efficient in their work
	- If a Manager doesnt do well, he may lose his job
- Internal competition, an effective board, independent reviews, all good methods to make sure the managers make good decisions for the Shareholders
- Diverse set of shareholders in the USA
- Conflicts with Society could reduce value
	- Corporate Social Responsibility
	- invest in education, build up society
- Debtholders
- Actually a red flag if your dividends rise! 
	- Even though we're residual claimants, the money should go to the debtholders
	- But we'll talk more about this when we're discussing financial decisions
	- Agency Cost of Debt: CoI between debtholders and shareholders during financial distress
- Market efficiency
- Semi strong efficiency required for market to react to news
