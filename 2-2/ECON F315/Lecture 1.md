- Basics of Financial Management
- AKA Corporate finance
- 4 main parts
	- Financing Decisions
	- Investment
	- Payout decisions 
	- Working Capital Management Decisions


- Say you want to start a business, you need capital. Where will you get it from?
	- This comes under Financing decisions
	- Banks, Friends, Sell own assets, sell shares, etc
	- Explore cost of each method
- Say you have multiple projects you want to fund, which one will you fund?
	- Analyse expected returns, cash flows, etc
	- Some projects cant be funded if you're funding another project, take all of this into consideration
- Say the project was successful, you receive profits
	- How much will you reinvest, how much will you pay out as dividends, etc
- Is profit maximisation the objective?
	- Consider: Is adding value to your firm better than just generating profit for it? Most people who invest aren't looking for dividends, they want their capital to appreciate!
	- Most of us would rather the company invest the dividend money back into itself.
	- So, profit maximisation is not the objective here (or at least, not the only objective)
	- We need to maximise the wealth of our shareholders, or maximise the value of the firm
	- But what's the difference? Surely more profit means the firm is more valuable right?
	- Profit = Revenue - Costs
	- The catch here is....
	- Two projects, A and B, both need $10M investment, both will generate cash flows.
	- A: 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7
	- B: 1 + 1 +1 + 50 + 60
	- A posts more immediate profits, but B adds more value to the firm, conflict!
	- EPS : Earnings per Share
	- Quarterly results, sales, profits, EPS(People tend to pay the most attention to this). 
	- Say people expect you to increase EPS by 100%, and you increase it by 110%, your share price shoots up (thereby making your firm more valuable!)
	- Hence, our objective of Financial Management is, first and foremost, to maximise the value of our Firm, NOT profit maximisation.
- Time Value of money, $100 right now is worth more that $100 in 1 year
- Because if you get it right away, you can invest the money in something (Say you put it in a savings account with an interest rate of 5%, you now have a whopping $105!). 
- If you choose the latter, you are
