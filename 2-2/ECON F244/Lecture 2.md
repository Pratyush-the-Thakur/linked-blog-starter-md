	
- Consumer goods consumed by household, Capital goods used by firms to expand production
- Households usually save, all income is not spent on consumption
- This leads to a pool of funds being available, firms use this to invest in capital good
- investment creates a market demand for capital goods
- They add to stock of capital in the economy and endow it for a larger future capacity of production, so the economy grows
- This would not be possible without savings
- Economic growth is positive when investment exceed the depreciated capital, allowing the next period's cycle to repeat on a larger scale

## Harrod Domer Model

National Income:   $Y(t) = C(t) + S(t)$
National output:  $Y(t)= C(t) + I(t)$

```
Consumption,Investment, Savings
```
For equilibrium: $S(t) = I(t)$

$$S(t) = sY(t)$$
$$ \theta= \frac{K(t)}{Y(t)} $$
$\theta$ = capital output ratio

$$K(t+1) = (1-d)K(t) + I(t)$$
where d is the depreciation rate
$$\theta Y_{t+1}  =\theta Y_t - d \theta Y_t + sY_t $$
$$\theta \frac{Y(t+1) - Y(t)}{Y(t)}  = s - d \theta$$
$$g = \frac{s}{\theta} -d$$
(divide both sides by $\theta$)
with g being the growth rate denoted by $\frac{Y(t+1) - Y(t)}{Y(t)}$
$$\theta Y(t+1) = \theta Y(t) - d\theta K(t) + sY(t)$$
Now, we account for population. with a growth rate of n
$$\theta y(t+1)P(t+1) = \theta y(t)P(t) - d\theta y(t)P(t) + sy(t)P(t)$$
$$ \frac{y(t+1)P(t+1)}{y(t)P(t)} = 1- d + \frac{s}{\theta}$$
P(t+1)/P(t) is (1+n) as the growth rate is n. same with g* and y(t+1) {g* is the per capita growth rate}
$$ 1 + g^* + n+ g^*n = 1 - d + \frac{s}{\theta} $$
neglecting $g^*n$ as it is very small
$$ \frac{s}{\theta} = g^* + n + d $$
Per capita growth equation
- Save and invest covered by s
- Capital  -> Output depends on $\theta$
- depreciation  d
- rate of pop growth 



- Warranted rate of growth = all savings absorbed into investment = $\frac{s}{\theta}$
- Natural rate of growth = rate required accounting for population
