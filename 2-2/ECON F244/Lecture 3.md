### Assumptions for Harrod Domer Model
- No difference between consumer and Capital goods, no depreciating
- Short run:
	- capital is the only factor
- Production function
	- linear homogenous
- Savings
	- constant proportion of income
	- $S_t = sY_t$
- Desired investments
	- Constant proportion of difference in income between two periods
 $$I_t = \theta(Y_{t+1} - Y_t)$$$$\frac{1}{\theta} = \frac{Y_{t+1} - Y_t}{K_{t+1} - K_t}$$
	- (Because $K_{t+1} = K_t(1-d) + I_t$) and d is 0 because no depreciation
- Closed, Laissez Faire economy
- Rates of Interest, prices and wages are all fixed
- Incremental capital output ratio (aka $\theta$) = the average capital output ratio
- Say production function is $F(k)$, the slope is..
	- $$F '(K) = MP_K$$
	- $$MRP_K = P_K$$
	- $$MP_KP = P_L$$
	- $$MP_K = r$$
	- Law of diminishing returns not followed here, Linear Production function
	- Slope of the Production function is $\frac{1}{\theta}$


### Capital Market Equilibrium
- Stock condition
	- Demand = Supply for Capital at each time period $t$
	- $$K^q_t = K^s_t$$
	- $$K^d_{t+1} - K^d_t = K^s_{t+1} - K^s_t$$
	- $$I_t = S_t$$
	- $$\theta(Y_{t+1} - Y_t) = sY_T$$
	- $$g = \frac{Y_{t+1} - Y_t}{Y_t} = \frac{s}{\theta}$$
- Flow condition

#### Long Run
- Labour is also a factor of production
- Isoquant
- not general Isoquant
- Capital and Labour used in fixed proportions
- Labour output ratio: Amount of labour to produce one unit of output, measures productivity
- We take the Labour supply growth as population growth rate (that is $n$)
- $$\frac{L^s_{t+1} - L^s_t}{L^s_t} = n$$
- $$L^d_{t+1} - L^d_t = a(Y_{t+1} - Y_t)$$
- $$a = \frac{L^d_{t+1} - L^d_t}{Y_{t+1} - Y_t} = \frac{L^d_t}{Y^d_t}$$
#### Equilibrium in the long run
- capital market equilibirum $g_t = \frac{s}{\theta}$
- $$a =(Y_{t+1} - Y_t) = nL^s_t = nL^d_t = anY_t$$
- we get $g_t = n = \frac{s}{\theta}$
- Equality is uncertain, $P(\frac{s}{\theta} = n) =0$
